Welcome to the CS Hackathon 2025 Web Development Workshop! This workshop is designed to introduce participants to the fundamentals of web development and provide practical tools you will be able to use during the hackathon.

This repository contains the code and resources used in the workshop. It is divided into several stages we will go through during the workshop, each stage is available in a separate branch.

### Stage 1 - Initializing the Project

This stage already contains the initial setup of the project. It includes all necessary boilerplate for working with React and TypeScript. This project was initialized using the following command (**No need to run this command yourself**):

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react-ts
```

Before you run this project, you need to install it's dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

In order to run the project, use the following command:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server of the project. You can view the application at `http://localhost:5173/`.
